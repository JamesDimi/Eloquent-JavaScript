// Write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace.
// The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order.
// The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument in order to reverse its elements.
// Neither may use the standard reverse method.
